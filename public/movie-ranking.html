<h1>The Best Movies According to Christine</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>Armageddon</h3> 
<p> This has been my favourite movie of a time. I watched it first back in college.
   I like it since I watched it because the portrayal of Bruce Willis as a father is very touching.</p>

<h3>Miracle In Cell No. 7</h3>

<p>It is a Korean Movie about a Dad under the spectrum who was falsely accused of killing the daughter of a powerful person. 
   He has as daughter and they don't have other family member. The Dad's co-inmates helped them so the daughter gets to enter
   their cell. It has a very sad ending because the Dad was sentenced to death.

<h3>Step Up All In</h3>
<p>It is my go to feel good movie. It's just a chill musical movie with lots of dancing.</p>
